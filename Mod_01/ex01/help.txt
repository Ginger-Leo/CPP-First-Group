Project Overview:
The goal of the Zombie Horde project is to create a program that manages a group of zombies using C++ classes, dynamic memory, and possibly arrays or vectors.

Step-by-step Guide:
1. Class Design:
Create a Zombie class:
Attributes: name (private).
Methods:
announce(): Prints a message like “I am [name]... BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...”
Constructor/Destructor: For setup and cleanup.
2. Zombie Horde Creation:
Create a function Zombie* zombieHorde(int N, std::string name);
Dynamically allocate an array of N zombies.
Initialize each zombie's name.
Return the pointer to the array.
3. Main Function:
Call zombieHorde() with a number and a name.
Use a loop to call announce() for each zombie.
Free the memory after using delete[].
Next Steps:
Set up Your Files:

Zombie.hpp: Class declaration.
Zombie.cpp: Class implementation.
main.cpp: Entry point.
Write the Makefile:

Add compilation rules and targets.
Test & Debug:

Test different numbers of zombies and ensure memory is managed correctly.

C++ Learning Journey

📚 Welcome to my first C++ project! This repository showcases my learning process as I explore C++ programming, starting from the basics and moving toward more complex concepts.

🖥️ About This Project
This repository contains simple C++ projects, exercises, and practice code as I learn the language. It includes tasks like working with variables, functions, control structures, and more advanced features as I progress.

🚀 What I’m Learning
C++ syntax and data types
Control flow (if, switch, while, for)
Functions and classes
Error handling with try and catch
Object-oriented programming (OOP)

🔧 Tools I’m Using
Compiler: g++ / clang++
IDE: VSCode on Linux
Version Control: Git and GitHub

🌱 Future Goals
Build small projects like a phonebook or calculator
Learn advanced features like file handling and templates
Explore game development with C++

📝 Disclaimer
This is a beginner-level project repository. The code here is part of my learning process, so expect some work-in-progress features and experiments.
